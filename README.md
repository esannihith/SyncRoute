SyncRoute

Next-generation social navigation app for seamless group travel

SyncRoute is a next-generation social navigation app designed to make traveling in groups simple, seamless, and fun. It merges the powerful real-time coordination of a gaming lobby with the robust utility of a turn-by-turn navigation system.

Ever tried coordinating a group of friends driving to a party, a family convoy heading to a vacation spot, or a team meeting at a new location? The constant switching between chat apps ("Where are you?") and map apps is chaotic and inefficient. SyncRoute solves this by creating a single, unified space for your group's journey.

Built with React Native, SyncRoute delivers a native experience for both Android and iOS from a single codebase.

The Problem It Solves

Coordinating group travel is messy. It involves:

Endless "where are you?" and "have you left yet?" texts

Creating temporary, single-purpose chat groups that clutter your messaging apps

The headache of updating everyone if the destination suddenly changes

Sharing personal phone numbers with people you might only be meeting for a single event

SyncRoute eliminates this friction by providing a temporary, real-time hub for every trip.

Key Features

SyncRoute is designed around two core experiences: powerful solo navigation and revolutionary group travel.

Tab 1: Solo Navigation (Home)

A full-featured navigation system for your everyday travel needs.

Intuitive Search: Quickly find destinations with predictive search and access recent locations

Turn-by-Turn Directions: Clear, voice-guided navigation with real-time traffic updates

Route Optimization: Get the fastest route based on current conditions, with options to avoid tolls or highways

Saved Places: One-tap navigation to your "Home," "Work," and other custom-saved locations

Tab 2: Group Navigation (Rooms)

This is where SyncRoute shines. Coordinate your group's journey in a private, temporary space.

Create Rooms Instantly: Create a "Room" for your trip and set a shared destination. A unique, easy-to-share code (e.g., LION-SUN-456) is instantly generated

Simple & Secure Joining: Users join via the unique code, eliminating the need to share phone numbers

Unified Group Map: View all room members as avatars moving in real-time on a single map

Dynamic Destination Updates: If the plan changes, the room admin can update the destination, and the app automatically reroutes every member

Individual ETAs: See an estimated time of arrival for every person in the room

Integrated Chat: Built-in chat keeps all trip-related communication in one place

Tab 3: User Profile & Settings

Manage your identity and customize your experience.

Personal Profile: Set your display name and profile picture

Gamified Statistics: Track your journeys, see how many trips youâ€™ve organized, and view fun stats

Custom Preferences: Adjust navigation settings, notifications, and privacy controls like "Ghost Mode"

Future Extensions & Vision

The roadmap for SyncRoute includes exciting features to deepen the social and utility aspects of the app:

Gamification: Earn points and badges for being the first to arrive, organizing trips, or discovering new places

Multi-Stop Trips: Admins can create itineraries with multiple waypoints for road trips and multi-destination events

Meet in the Middle Suggestions: Intelligent recommendations for fair and convenient meeting points

what3words Integration: Hyper-precise navigation to tricky locations like festival entrances or picnic spots
